# Importing an existing VPC

![aws-existing-vpc](./aws-existing-vpc.svg)

This is a sample project for Python development with CDK.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the .env
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
(.venv) $ cdk synth --all
```

If your VPC is created outside your CDK app, you can use `Vpc.fromLookup()`.
The CDK CLI will search for the specified VPC in the the stackâ€™s region and account,
and import the subnet configuration.

To import an existing VPC, you should specify the following environment variables.

```
(.venv) $ export CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
(.venv) $ export CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=$(aws configure get region)
```

If you pass context variable such as `vcp_name=<your vpc name>` (e.g. `vpc_name='default'`), you can use the existing VPC.

```
(.venv) $ cdk synth -c vpc_name='default' --all
```

Use `cdk deploy` command to create the stack shown above.

<pre>
(.venv) $ cdk deploy -c vpc_name='default' --all
</pre>

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Clean Up

Delete the CloudFormation stack by running the below command.

```
(.venv) $ cdk destroy --force --all
```

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
